                Iran's leadership has said it is are weighing a response to this weekend's Israeli airstrikes, as the
                country called on the UN security council to meet today. Parmeshwar Bawa is in conversation with Middle
                east expert Dr Reza Kanzadeh and geopolitical analyst Irina Tsukerman to discuss Iran's next moves and
                the broader impact.

                </figure>
                In a major step to improve the diplomatic relations between the two countries, India and China will
                complete the process of military disengagement across the Line of Actual Control (LAC) by October 28-29,
                reported ANI. Patrolling across certain areas of the LAC will commence once the troops of both sides
                have completed disengagement and dismantled temporary structures, reported PTI.
                <br>
                This comes days after a crucial agreement between India and China aimed at resolving the border dispute.
                This was also the first successful resolution to the dispute since the 2020 Galwan clash between the two
                forces, which led to multiple casualties.
                <br>
                The military disengagement between the two countries will take place at two friction points across the
                LAC - Demchok and Depsang Plains in eastern Ladakh.
                <br>
                A source in the Indian Army told ANI, “The latest agreements will only be valid for Demchok and Depsang
                and not other places. This agreement will not be applicable to other friction zones. Troops from both
                sides will fall back to positions they held pre-April 2020 and they will patrol areas where they
                patrolled till April 2020.”

                </figure>
                As the Diwali week begins, Delhi's overall air quality on Monday morning was better than the previous
                day, but still in the 'very poor' category, which is hazardous for health. The national capital recorded
                a 24-hour average Air Quality Index (AQI) of 264 at 6 am, almost 90 points down from yesterday's AQI.
                However, the Delhi AQI still falls in the "very poor" category, the IQair website showed.

                This marks a significant improvement in air quality compared to the past two days when the AQI had
                dropped vigorously due to a lack of strong winds.

                New Delhi: A man in Delhi has been arrested along with his father for allegedly attacking cops after he
                was stopped for using a modified silencer on his bike, officials said today.
                A Delhi Police inspector and a constable were injured in the incident that occurred in southeast Delhi's
                Jamia Nagar on Sunday evening.
                <br>
                According to the officials, the police personnel stopped the man, Asif, when his Royal Enfield Bullet
                was making excess noise.
                <br>
                During the inspection, it was found that the motorcycle's silencer had been "illegally" modified,
                enhancing noise beyond permissible limits and contravening the Motor Vehicles Act, officials said.
                <br>
                Asif, 24, then called his father, Riyazuddin, to the spot, and the latter allegedly tried to take away
                the bike along with him forcibly.
                <br>
                When the inspector tried to stop them, Riyazuddin caught hold of him, and Asif punched him near his eye,
                the officials said. They also attacked some of the other police personnel.

                <h3>BSA Gold Star 650 real world fuel economy tested, explained
                </h3>
                <figure>
                    <img src="https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https://cdni.autocarindia.com/Features/B.jpg&w=700&c=1"

                    <figcaption>Recently launched BSA Goldstar 650</figcaption>
                </figure>
                The made-in-India BSA Gold Star 650 has been available overseas for a couple of years but Classic
                Legends has now launched the bike in India. That gave us a chance to pit it against its closest
                competitor, the Royal Enfield Interceptor 650 and also to see how fuel efficient the engine is
                <br>
                Our fuel efficiency tests are split into separate city and highway runs. The city run was conducted on a
                variety of roads in South Mumbai with everything from jam packed traffic under the JJ Flyover to faster,
                more flowing traffic down Marine drive. After covering over 40km, the bike returned 22.96kpl. With that
                completed, we then covered about 60 kilometres of highway riding while holding speeds of 70-80kph. In
                this test, the BSA Gold Star’s mileage increased to 29.14kpl.
                <br>
                It is worth noting that while these numbers are a little lower than the Royal Enfield Interceptor 650,
                the BSA actually proved to be slightly quicker in our performance tests, despite being tested in wet
                conditions.

                The Gold Star weighs slightly less than the Enfield, but its big single cannot match the RE’s smooth
                parallel twin engine when it comes to fuel efficiency, although it makes up for this with more low and
                midrange torque than any other made in India motorcycle.

                Even though passenger vehicle leader Maruti Suzuki’s domestic market wholesales, at 8,44,614 units, were
                down 3 percent year on year (YoY) in the April-September 2024 period, the company is riding a wave of
                export demand. In the first half of FY2025, Maruti Suzuki shipped a total of 1,47,063 cars, SUVs and
                MPVs, up 12 percent YoY. This number is 52 percent of its record export sales of 2,80,712 units in
                FY2024 and ensures that the carmaker is likely to retain the title of ‘India’s top PV exporter’ for the
                fourth fiscal year in a row.

                <h3>Lawrence Bishnoi has created more employment than the Indian Govt in the last ten years: Reports
                </h3>
                <figure>

                </figure>
                The report reveals that the Lawrence Bishnoi gang has over seven hundred people employed directly. Since
                Lawrence Bishnoi has begun threatening Salman Khan and other celebrities, hirings in the security
                business in India have increased exponentially. Salman Khan has personally hired many duplicates to
                wander around, hoping to confuse Lawrence Bishnoi about who the real Salman is, resulting in a massive
                increase in indirect employment.
                <br>
                The surge in the Indian telecom sector post-2014 was actually driven by Lawrence Bishnoi’s gang members
                making numerous threatening international calls. This resulted in significant earnings for telecom
                companies, leading to more employment as well as lower prices.

                    <figcaption>website crashes on important day</figcaption>
                </figure>
                Bookmyshow opened ticket bookings for the band Coldplay’s concert today, but its website crashed within
                ten minutes. This caused several serious situations around the country; while a CA lost his title
                because he was able to book the tickets on his first attempt, a man from Bengaluru experienced PTSD
                flashbacks of his JEE results. All of this attracted the attention of the Finance Minister, who was
                looking for an alternative website for ITR filing, as the current one was not crashing as frequently. As
                she saw Bookmyshow’s website performance, she immediately approved it as an alternative ITR filing
                portal.
                <br>
                Speaking to the Fauxy, the CEO of Bookmyshow said, “We are honored to be chosen by the Finance Minister.
                However, we are not satisfied with our website’s performance, as it still took ten minutes to crash. We
                will work hard, and one day our website will crash immediately, just like other prestigious government
                websites.”
